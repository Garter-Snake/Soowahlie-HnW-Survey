                    Why are we conducting a survey?
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The Soowahlie Health and Wellness committee is beginning the process of constructing a 5-year plan for Soowahlie. 
                    We are looking to collect feedback from the community and band members to help determine how aware people are to the current services provided by Soowahlie.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As well as decide what should be focused on in the 5-year plan based on the feedback and input we receive from the community and band members in the survey we are conducting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope this survey provides the opportunity for every band member to voice their opinion on what the Health and Wellness Committee and Soowahlie should focus on to better support the community.

                <h3>Information about the gift card and draw.</h3>

                <p>
                    As mentioned on the homepage, we are offering a small gift card for those who participated and submitted feedback on the survey. 
                    This applies to the paper survey, in-person survey and the online survey. 
                    However, with the online survey, you will still need to come into the Health Office to receive the gift card.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are offering Mc Donald's, Tim Horton's, Starbucks, Dairy Queen, Booster Juice gift cards
                </p>

                <p>
                    Only 1 gift card per person who has completed the survey. The gift cards are also given at random.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks to FNHA, we have been provided a few extra gifts that we are giving away in a draw! 2 travel mugs and a few blankets.
                </p>

                <p>
