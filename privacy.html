                The Soowahlie Health and Wellness Survey will aim to keep the participants anonymous.
            </p>

            <p>
                This survey does not collect any participant data beyond the information you provide in the survey. 
                The survey will ask for a broad age range, how many services you are aware of, and the opportunity to share your own thoughts and feedback.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please do not share any private information that you do not want to be known or that could reveal your identity.
            </p>

            <p>
                The survey is conducted using a third-party application called <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" target="_blank">FormSubmit</a>. They do not collect any data and serve as the backend for us to collect the survey data.

            <p>
                As mentioned in the About section, we offer a small gift card for those who have completed the survey. 
                In order to receive the gift card, you will need to come into the Soowahlie Health Office. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We do not collect any personal information about you when you come in. 
                We only require a proof of completion of the survey in the form of a screenshot of the completion page.
            </p>

            <p>
                We do not collect any information about who comes in to collect the gift card and we do not know who submitted what response when they do come in.
            </p>

            <p>
                When we do the announcement for the draw, we will only announce the winning number. If the prize(s) are not claimed in a timely manor, we will announce a new winner on the original post.
